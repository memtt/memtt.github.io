abstract="Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is one of the main architectures of today's high-performance server. The key feature of NUMA is the non-uniformity of access latency. Access from a processor to attached memory is faster, and it also reduces the possibility of causing contention on interconnect links and memory controller. Multithreaded programs may experience high memory latency without careful placement of data and thread. Thus, it is necessary to develop a tool to identify and help ameliorate NUMA problems. In this paper, we present a data-centric tool to analyze the performance of multithreaded programs on NUMA architectures and provide advices on how to improve the performance. This paper describes the design and implementation of the tool. The tool is evaluated on Linux using three benchmark applications, and the evaluation shows how this tool helps to identify costly variables and choose optimization methods. The result shows performance improvement of upto 51.92{\%}.",

	abstract="Message-Passing Interface (MPI) has become a standard for parallel applications in high-performance computing. Within a single cluster node, MPI implementations benefit from the shared memory to speed-up intra-node communications while the underlying network protocol is exploited to communicate between nodes. However, it requires the allocation of additional buffers leading to a memory-consumption overhead. This may become an issue on future clusters with reduced memory amount per core. In this article, we propose an MPI implementation built upon the MPC framework called MPC-MPI reducing the overall memory footprint. We obtained up to 47{\%} of memory gain on benchmarks and a real-world application.",

	abstract="Over the last decade, Message Passing Interface (MPI) has become a very successful parallel programming environment for distributed memory architectures such as clusters. However, the architecture of cluster node is currently evolving from small symmetric shared memory multiprocessors towards massively multicore, Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) hardware. Although regular MPI implementations are using numerous optimizations to realize zero copy cache-oblivious data transfers within shared-memory nodes, they might prevent applications from achieving most of the hardware's performance simply because the scheduling of heavyweight processes is not flexible enough to dynamically fit the underlying hardware topology. This explains why several research efforts have investigated hybrid approaches mixing message passing between nodes and memory sharing inside nodes, such as MPI+OpenMP solutions [1,2]. However, these approaches require lots of programming efforts in order to adapt/rewrite existing MPI applications.",

	abstract="With the advent of the multicore era, the architecture of supercomputers in HPC (High-Performance Computing) is evolving to integrate larger computational nodes with an increasing number of cores. This change contributes to evolve the parallel programming models currently used by scientific applications. Multiple approaches advocate for the use of thread-based programming models. One direction is the exploitation of the thread-based MPI programming model mixed with OpenMP leading to hybrid applications. But mixing parallel programming models involves a fine management of data placement and visibility. Indeed, every model includes extensions to privatize some variable declarations, i.e., to create a small amount of storage only accessible by one task or thread. This article proposes an extension to the Thread-Local Storage (TLS) mechanism to support data placement in the thread-based MPI model and the data visibility with nested hybrid MPI/OpenMP applications.",

	abstract="The advent of multicore processors advocates for a hybrid programming model like MPI+OpenMP. Therefore, OpenMP runtimes require solid performance from a small number of threads (one MPI task per socket, OpenMP inside each socket) to a large number of threads (one MPI task per node, OpenMP inside each node). To tackle this issue, we propose a mechanism to improve performance of thread synchronization with a large spectrum of threads. It relies on a hierarchical tree traversed in a different manner according to the number of threads inside the parallel region. Our approach exposes high performance for thread activation (parallel construct) and thread synchronization (barrier construct). Several papers study hierarchical structures to launch and synchronize OpenMP threads [1, 2]. They tested tree-based approaches to distribute and synchronize threads, but they do not explore mixed hierarchical solutions.",

abstract="Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is one of the main architectures of today's high-performance server. The key feature of NUMA is the non-uniformity of access latency. Access from a processor to attached memory is faster, and it also reduces the possibility of causing contention on interconnect links and memory controller. Multithreaded programs may experience high memory latency without careful placement of data and thread. Thus, it is necessary to develop a tool to identify and help ameliorate NUMA problems. In this paper, we present a data-centric tool to analyze the performance of multithreaded programs on NUMA architectures and provide advices on how to improve the performance. This paper describes the design and implementation of the tool. The tool is evaluated on Linux using three benchmark applications, and the evaluation shows how this tool helps to identify costly variables and choose optimization methods. The result shows performance improvement of up to 51.92 {\%}.",
