  abstract={The CMS experiment at LHC has a very large body of software of its own and uses extensively software from outside the experiment. Understanding the performance of such a complex system is a very challenging task, not the least because there are extremely few developer tools capable of profiling software systems of this scale, or producing useful reports. CMS has mainly used IgProf, valgrind, callgrind and OProfile for analysing the performance and memory usage patterns of our software. We describe the challenges, at times rather extreme ones, faced as we've analysed the performance of our software and how we've developed an understanding of the performance features. We outline the key lessons learnt so far and the actions taken to make improvements. We describe why an in-house general profiler tool still ends up besting a number of renowned open-source tools, and the improvements we've made to it in the recent year.}

matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, 
geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a 
comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, 
a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy 
range starting, in some cases, from 250 eV and extending in others to the TeV 
energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models 
utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for 
optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a 
worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been 
created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and 
implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications 
in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and 
medical physics. "
